a self-taught cybersecurity learner focused on Blue Team skills, especially SOC analysis and threat detection.
ðŸ’¼ My background also includes roles in IT sales and healthcare (dentistry), making me strong in communication, pressure handling, and cross-disciplinary thinkingâ€”assets in incident response and stakeholder communication.

## Objective
 Based in Egypt, Iâ€™m actively seeking remote entry-level SOC Analyst roles. I bring a strong understanding of real-world cyber threats, a relentless work ethic, and the ability to hit the ground running with any team.
